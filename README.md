##Interviewee 

Interviewee is a Gemini-powered interview preparation platform that turns a resume and job description into a personalized interview blueprint, then runs a live, adaptive interview with real-time coaching and scoring.

Instead of static practice questions, Interviewee simulates how real interviewers think — probing gaps, adjusting follow-ups, and evaluating answers dynamically.

## What It Does

Interview Blueprint Engine

Analyzes a resume + job description

Identifies role focus, risk gaps, company-specific notes

Predicts the most likely interview format (behavioral + technical or behavioral + case)

Live Interview Simulation

Launches a real-time interview based on the blueprint

Asks adaptive follow-up questions like a real interviewer

Supports voice input and text-to-speech for realism

Coaching & Scorecard

Evaluates answers using the STAR framework

Scores clarity, structure, impact, and role fit

Highlights strengths, gaps, and rewrites answers for improvement

## How Gemini 3 Is Used

Interviewee is powered by Gemini 3 Flash Preview and uses Gemini in two core ways:

Structured reasoning: Generating explainable interview blueprints as JSON

Adaptive intelligence: Orchestrating live interviews, scoring responses, detecting STAR components, and producing coaching feedback in real time

This makes the system fast, transparent, and controllable — not a black box.

🌍 Why It Matters

Interviewee lowers the barrier to high-quality interview preparation, especially for early-career and career-switching candidates who don’t have access to expensive coaching.
